# C89 for dcc (CP/M 2.2 / Z80)

dcc is a cross-compiler (runs on the host) that emits Z80 assembly for CP/M 2.2.
The runtime is [DCCRTL.MAC](DCCRTL.MAC); programs run on real hardware or an
emulator such as **ntvcm** (Altair 8800).

**Assume standard C89 plus the C99 conveniences listed below.** This skill
documents only where dcc *deviates* from what an experienced C programmer
expects — anything not listed here behaves as standard C89/C99.

## When to use

- Writing, porting, or reviewing C compiled by `dcc`.
- Building/running/debugging a dcc program (`ma.sh`, `ntvcm`).
- CP/M file I/O, VT100/ANSI console UIs, or DCCRTL work.

## Deviations from standard C

**Types — a 16-bit machine:**

| Type | dcc | Note |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| `int` / `short` | 16-bit | overflow at ±32767; use `long` + `%ld` for range |
| `long` | 32-bit | |
| `float` | 32-bit | **the only floating type** |
| `double` / `long double` | — | **not a keyword; using it is a compile error** |
| pointer / `size_t` / `ptrdiff_t` / `wchar_t` | 16-bit | flat 64 KB space |
| `char` | 8-bit **signed** | use `unsigned char` for bytes ≥ 0x80 / table indices |
| `FILE` | `int` | |

Multi-byte values are little-endian (Z80-native).

**Floating point is single-precision only:**

- Write `float`; unsuffixed constants (`3.14`) are already `float`, not `double`.
- No `float`→`double` promotion in varargs (there is no double), so
  `printf("%f", x)` consumes a 32-bit `float` directly — but **requires the
  `-ffloatio` build flag**; without it `%f` silently does nothing.
- `<math.h>` provides the full single-precision set (`sinf`/`expf`/`powf`/… each
  with an unsuffixed alias that stays single-precision), but the transcendentals
  are ~5–6-digit polynomial approximations.
- No `atof`/`strtod` (both return `double`) — parse decimals yourself
  (`strtol`/`strtoul` handle integers). Worked parser in pitfalls.md.

**The library is a subset.** A missing function is a **link** error
(`unresolved external`), not a compile error, so check
[references/library.md](./references/library.md) before assuming one exists.
Notably absent: `atof`/`strtod`, `<locale.h>`/`<signal.h>`/`<time.h>`, and
some stdio entries (`fgetc`, `ungetc`, `rename`, …).

**printf/scanf are a subset.** No `+`/space/`#` flags and no `*`
width/precision; scanf is integer/string only (no `%f`, scansets, `%n`, `%p`).
Conversion tables in library.md.

**No stack/heap guard.** Heap and stack share memory and can collide silently.
Size the stack with `-stack N` (default 512); keep big buffers `static`/global.

**Source filenames MUST be 8.3 and uppercase-safe** (≤ 8-char base, ≤ 3-char
extension, no extra dots). `foo.c` → `FOO.COM`, run as `ntvcm FOO`. A source
whose name violates 8.3 (e.g. `my_long_name.c`, `parse.test.c`) won't build —
ntvcm reports `argument is not a valid CP/M 8.3 filename`; rename the file when
you see that error.

**Missing `<...>` headers are silently ignored** — calls fall back to implicit
`int` and still link via the runtime, with no type-checking. A missing
`"..."` header is fatal. If standard calls compile but misbehave, check that
`-I` actually resolves the dcc headers.

## C99 conveniences dcc accepts (beyond C89)

These behave as standard C99: `for`-init declarations with loop scope, `//` line
comments, block-scoped declarations (inner blocks shadow outer names), and
`inline` (parsed, ignored). `const`/`volatile`/`register`/`auto` are accepted
but inert (`const` constant-folds initializers only — not read-only memory).
K&R function definitions are still accepted; prefer prototypes for new code.

Not present: any other C99/C11 feature (`restrict`, `_Bool`, VLAs, compound
literals, designated initializers).

**Identifiers:** full internal significance; externals stay distinct well past
C89's 6-char minimum (verified to ~13 chars), and only ~16+ identical leading
characters can silently collide at link time — make such a one-file helper
`static` if it ever matters. (This is *not* BDS C's 7-char rule.)

## Build and run

The standard helper scripts live in the dcc repo. **Set these env vars first**
(they make `ma.sh` use the local binaries):

```sh
export PATH="/Users/<USER_NAME_FOLDER>/GitHub/ntvcm:/Users/<USER_NAME_FOLDER>/GitHub/dcc:$PATH"
export DCC=./dcc DCCPEEP=./dccpeep DCCRTLSTRIP=./dccrtlstrip
```

**Build/run one program** (compile → peephole → strip runtime → M80 → L80):

```sh
./ma.sh foo peep      # foo.c -> FOO.COM (peephole optimised); use 'nopeep' to skip
ntvcm FOO             # run it (uppercase, no extension)
ntvcm FOO ARG1 ARG2   # with CP/M command-line args
```

> The source name passed to `ma.sh` must be 8.3-clean (base ≤ 8 chars,
> extension ≤ 3, no extra dots). ntvcm reports
> `argument is not a valid CP/M 8.3 filename` for a non-conforming name —
> rename the file when you see it.

**Useful `dcc` options:** `-o file` (output .mac), `-c`/`-module` (linkable
module), `-f`/`-ffloatio` (float printf), `-stack N`/`-s N`/`--stack N` (reserve
stack; default 512 — heap and stack share memory, **no guard**), `-I dir` (or
joined `-Idir`; repeatable), `-Dname[=v]`,
`-Uname`, `-v`, `-h`. `_DCC_=1` is always predefined.

**Finding the standard headers (`-I`).** dcc resolves `#include <stdio.h>` by
checking the current directory first, then each `-I` directory in order. The
bundled headers (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `math.h`, …) live in the
**dcc repo root**, so:

- Building **inside** the dcc repo (as `ma.sh` does): they're found
  automatically via the current directory — no `-I` needed.
- Building **elsewhere**: point dcc at the repo, e.g.
  `dcc -I /path/to/dcc myapp.c -o myapp.mac` (repeat `-I` for more dirs).

Gotcha: a `<...>` header that isn't found is **silently ignored** (you lose its
prototypes and fall back to implicit `int`, so calls still compile and link via
the runtime but without type-checking); a missing `"..."` header is a fatal
error. If standard calls compile yet misbehave, check that `-I` actually
resolves the dcc headers.

Notes: M80 needs CRLF (`ma.sh` converts). `RTLMIN.MAC` is generated per-app by
`dccrtlstrip` during the build — don't hand-edit it.

## Top pitfalls

The deviations above are the pitfalls. For worked examples (the `float` decimal
parser, `%f`/`-ffloatio`, 16-bit overflow, signed `char`, CP/M 8.3 names, the
stack/heap collision) see [references/pitfalls.md](./references/pitfalls.md);
for the full function inventory and `printf`/`scanf` conversion tables see
[references/library.md](./references/library.md).

## Workflow

1. **Plan for the deviations.** Floating point → single precision (no `double`);
   decimal parsing → a `float` parser (no `atof`); `time`/`signal`/`locale` →
   don't exist.
2. **Check the library** in [references/library.md](./references/library.md)
   before calling anything unverified — a missing function is a link error,
   not a compile error.
3. **Match repo conventions.** Read a nearby working program first. In the dcc
   repo, the exhaustive reference is
   [dcc-c89-reference-guide.md](dcc-c89-reference-guide.md) at the repo root.
4. **Build and run**: `./ma.sh <name> peep && ntvcm <NAME>` (add the `-ffloatio`
   path if you use `%f`); redirect stdin for interactive apps and compare
   against expected output.
