# Appendix: compiler architecture

This appendix describes the dcc toolchain: the compiler `dcc`, the peephole
optimizer `dccpeep`, the runtime size reducer `dccrtlstrip`, and the Microsoft
`M80` / `L80` assembler and linker.

!!! note "Host-resident tools"
  `dcc`, `dccpeep`, and `dccrtlstrip` run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. They
  never run on a Z80. They emit Z80 assembly text and CP/M `.COM` files that
  run under CP/M-80, for example via the `ntvcm` emulator.

## The toolchain at a glance

A single `.c` file becomes a CP/M `.COM` executable through a short pipeline.
Each stage has one job and hands a text or object file to the next:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SRC([".c source"]) --> DCC["dcc<br/>C89 -> Z80 asm"]
    DCC --> MAC([".MAC assembly"])
    MAC --> PEEP["dccpeep<br/>peephole optimizer"]
    PEEP --> MAC2([".MAC optimized"])
    MAC2 --> M80A["M80<br/>assemble"]
    RTL([" DCCRTL.MAC<br/>full runtime"]) --> STRIP["dccrtlstrip<br/>dead-block removal"]
    MAC2 -. references .-> STRIP
    STRIP --> RTLMIN([" RTLMIN.MAC<br/>used routines only"])
    RTLMIN --> M80B["M80<br/>assemble"]
    M80A --> REL([" app.REL"])
    M80B --> RRTL([" RTLMIN.REL"])
    REL --> L80["L80<br/>link"]
    RRTL --> L80
    L80 --> COM([".COM executable"])
```

| Stage | Tool | Input | Output | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compile | `dcc` | `.c` | `.MAC` | Translate C89 to Z80/M80 assembly |
| Optimize | `dccpeep` | `.MAC` | `.MAC` | Local peephole rewriting of the asm |
| Reduce runtime | `dccrtlstrip` | `DCCRTL.MAC` + app `.MAC` | `RTLMIN.MAC` | Keep only the runtime routines the app references |
| Assemble | `M80` | `.MAC` | `.REL` | Object code (relocatable) |
| Link | `L80` | `.REL` files | `.COM` | Resolve symbols into a CP/M executable |

The `dccpeep` stage is optional (`./scripts/ma.ps1 name -Mode nopeep` skips it
when run from PowerShell in the dcc checkout). `dccrtlstrip` runs against the
*final* application assembly so it
sees the real set of runtime symbols the program calls.

## Compiler Shape

dcc is a single-pass, syntax-directed translator. It does not build an AST or an
intermediate representation. As the parser recognizes a construct, it emits the
corresponding Z80 assembly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SRC([".c source"]) --> PP["preprocess +<br/>#include splice"]
    PP --> LEX["lexer<br/>(next_token)"]
    LEX --> PARSE["recursive-descent parse<br/>+ emit (one pass)"]
    PARSE --> ASM([".MAC assembly"])
    PARSE -. consults .-> ORA["type oracle<br/>(side-effect-free)"]
    ORA -. type verdict .-> PARSE
```

The phases are:

| Classic phase | Conventional design | dcc's approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lexical analysis | Separate tokenizer | `next_token` lexer in `dcc_preproc.c` (integrated with the preprocessor) |
| Parsing | Build an AST | Recursive-descent parse with **no AST**; actions emit code inline |
| Semantic analysis | Walk the AST, annotate types | Done *during* the parse against live symbol/type tables |
| Intermediate representation | One or more IRs (e.g. three-address code, SSA) | **None** — C maps straight to Z80 |
| Machine-independent optimization | Passes over the IR | Mostly absent by design; some peephole/idiom fast paths in codegen |
| Code generation | Lower IR to target | Emitted directly by the parser's semantic actions |
| Machine-dependent optimization | Target peephole pass | Separate program `dccpeep` over the emitted text |

### Type prediction

Without an AST, the parser must choose 16-bit, 32-bit, or float code before it
emits each operand of an operator, conditional arm, or branch condition.

dcc uses two mechanisms:

- A shallow source-text peek (`peek_simple_unary_type`, `snippet_simple_type`)
  checks the first token or two of the upcoming operand.
- The type oracle (`dcc_type_oracle.c`) walks the full expression grammar and
  returns the type the generator will produce, applying the usual arithmetic
  conversions without emitting code.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    GEN["code generator<br/>reaches an operator"] --> SNAP["snapshot lexer state<br/>(posi, tok, line, flags)"]
    SNAP --> WALK["type oracle walks the<br/>full operand grammar"]
    WALK --> VERDICT["return C type verdict"]
    VERDICT --> RESTORE["restore lexer state"]
    RESTORE --> EMIT["re-parse + emit<br/>correctly-typed code"]
```

The oracle snapshots and restores lexer state before returning. It supplies
whole-expression type information without a full AST or a second code-generating
pass.

## Inside dcc: module architecture

The compiler is one binary built from focused modules that all share a single
umbrella header, `dcc.h`. Because parsing and code generation are interleaved
and share a large amount of file-scope state (the source buffer, the lookahead
token, the symbol/type tables, per-function codegen flags), the natural layout
is the classic single-binary compiler shape: **one shared header, many
cooperating `.c` files**, with all mutable state defined once in
`dcc_state.c`.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph SHARED["Shared contract"]
        H["dcc.h<br/>macros, types, externs, prototypes"]
        STATE["dcc_state.c<br/>defines the shared globals"]
    end

    subgraph FE["1 - Front end"]
        DRV["dcc.c<br/>driver, CLI, main()"]
        PP["dcc_preproc.c<br/>preprocessor + lexer"]
        DIAG["dcc_diag_emit.c<br/>diagnostics + emit"]
        ASM["dcc_asmname.c<br/>C name -> asm symbol"]
    end

    subgraph TYP["2 - Types, symbols, constants"]
        TYPES["dcc_types.c"]
        SYM["dcc_symbols.c"]
        CONST["dcc_constexpr.c"]
        FOLD["dcc_fold.c"]
        ORACLE["dcc_type_oracle.c"]
    end

    subgraph CG["3 - Code generation"]
        EXPR["dcc_expr.c<br/>expressions, calls"]
        OPS["dcc_ops.c<br/>arithmetic, bitwise"]
        CMP["dcc_cmp.c<br/>compare, branch"]

    end

    subgraph TOP["4 - Top level + output"]
        FUNC["dcc_func.c<br/>functions, frame layout"]
        DATA["dcc_data.c<br/>data-section emission"]
    end

    SHARED -.included by all.-> FE
    FE ==> TYP ==> CG ==> TOP
```

The thick arrows are the dominant translation pipeline (front end → types →
code generation → output). Within a stage the files are peers, and because
every module sees the same prototypes through `dcc.h`, any module may call any
other — the arrows show the usual direction, not a hard layering rule.

| Group | Modules | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared | `dcc.h`, `dcc_state.c` | Contract + single definition of all shared state |
| Front end | `dcc.c`, `dcc_preproc.c`, `dcc_diag_emit.c`, `dcc_asmname.c` | Driver/CLI, preprocessor + lexer, diagnostics + emit primitives, C-name-to-asm-symbol mapping |
| Types / symbols | `dcc_types.c`, `dcc_symbols.c`, `dcc_constexpr.c`, `dcc_fold.c`, `dcc_type_oracle.c` | Type system, symbol tables, constant-expression evaluation, constant folding, the type oracle |
| Code generation | `dcc_expr.c`, `dcc_ops.c`, `dcc_cmp.c`, `dcc_assign.c`, `dcc_stmt.c`, `dcc_decl.c`, `dcc_stmt_fast.c` | Expression, operator, comparison, assignment, statement, and declaration lowering |
| Top level / output | `dcc_func.c`, `dcc_data.c` | Function/frame parsing and data-section emission |

## Inside dccpeep: a fixpoint peephole optimizer

`dccpeep` is dcc's **machine-dependent optimizer**. It reads the emitted `.MAC`
as an array of text lines and applies dozens of small *peephole* rewrites —
each one matches a short local instruction pattern and replaces it with a
cheaper equivalent (for example folding a redundant store/reload, threading a
jump-to-jump, turning an `ld`/`cp` against zero into `or a`, or replacing an
absolute `jp` in range with a relative `jr`).

dccpeep runs its rewrite catalogue to a **fixpoint** so one rewrite can expose
the pattern another rewrite needs:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    READ["read .MAC into line array"] --> SWEEP["run all peephole passes once"]
    SWEEP --> CHK{"any pass<br/>changed a line?"}
    CHK -->|yes, and under 30 passes| SWEEP
    CHK -->|no change, or 30 passes| POST["post-convergence passes"]
    POST --> FRAME["IX-frame elimination<br/>+ optional shared stubs (-Os)"]
    FRAME --> FINAL["final tidy:<br/>dead-load removal, jp -> jr"]
    FINAL --> WRITE["write optimized .MAC"]
```

Key design points:

- **Driven to convergence.** The main loop re-runs every pass until a full
  sweep makes no change (capped at 30 iterations), because passes feed each
  other — e.g. a store/reload elimination can create a dead label that a later
  pass then removes.
- **Order-sensitive post-passes.** A few transforms must run *after*
  convergence: the signed-compare constant-bias fold, IX-frame elimination,
  and the shared-stub passes all depend on the instruction stream having
  settled, because earlier structural passes recognise loops by their
  canonical (un-folded) shape.
- **Two optimization goals.** `-Ot` (default, "time") inlines helper sequences
  for speed; `-Os` ("size") factors recurring sequences into shared `call`
  stubs to shrink the binary. The mode is chosen on the command line and
  changes which post-convergence passes fire.

!!! tip "Why a separate program instead of an in-compiler pass"
    Keeping the peephole optimizer as a standalone text-to-text filter keeps
    the compiler simple and allows inspection, diffing, and skipping
    optimization (`nopeep`). The assembly is the contract between the two tools.

## The runtime: a block-structured library sized for stripping

The runtime `DCCRTL.MAC` is a single ~16,500-line assembly source, but its
*architecture* is what makes the toolchain's "pay only for what you use"
property possible. Rather than one monolithic blob, the runtime is written as
**~220 independent blocks**, each delimited by a `public` label and each
depending only on a small shared prelude. A program never links the whole
library — `dccrtlstrip` keeps only the blocks the application actually
references (the mark-and-sweep details are in the companion appendix
[*Runtime optimization*](01-dccrtlstrip.md)). The architectural
consequence is that **every routine has a well-defined, measurable size cost**.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph RT["DCCRTL.MAC (~16,500 lines, ~220 public blocks)"]
        BASE["always-present baseline<br/>~226 lines, 6 blocks<br/>(start, argv/console, heap, exit)"]
        IO["stdio blocks<br/>printf, file I/O core"]
        MEM["memory blocks<br/>malloc/free/realloc"]
        LONG["32-bit long blocks"]
        FLT["float core + math.h"]
        STR["string / ctype blocks"]
    end
    BASE --> APP(["linked .COM<br/>baseline + referenced blocks only"])
    IO -. if referenced .-> APP
    MEM -. if referenced .-> APP
    LONG -. if referenced .-> APP
    FLT -. if referenced .-> APP
    STR -. if referenced .-> APP
```

### Two numbers describe every routine

Because the runtime is block-structured, each public routine has two costs that
the build-time size hook (`docs/docs/hooks/runtime_sizes.py`) measures directly:

- **self** — the source lines in the routine's own block.
- **marginal** — self *plus* every additional block it transitively links
  beyond the always-present baseline. This is the real incremental cost of
  using a routine in a program that otherwise wouldn't need it.

The gap between the two is the whole story of the runtime's size architecture: a
small `self` with a large `marginal` means the routine sits on top of a big
shared substrate (the file-I/O core, or the float arithmetic core).

### The always-present baseline (~226 lines)

Six blocks are always linked because they are reachable from the forced `start`
root: program entry and heap/BSS setup, the command-tail `argv` builder (which
also contains the console writer `__conout`), the heap-state words, and
`exit`. Console output therefore costs essentially nothing extra — `putchar`
and `puts` call into code that is already present.

### What the feature groups cost

The runtime's size is dominated by a few shared cores. Routines that sit on a
core are cheap individually but expensive to introduce, because the first one
links the whole core:

| Feature group | Shared core it links | Marginal cost (lines) |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Console output (`putchar`, `puts`, integer `printf`) | none (baseline only) | ~12–840 |
| File-stream + low-level I/O (`fopen`, `fread`, `fputs`, `fprintf`) | FCB/DMA file core (~470) | ~470–1,500 |
| `scanf` / `sscanf` / `fscanf` | shared 697-line scan core | ~1,290–1,305 |
| Memory (`malloc`/`free`/`realloc`/`calloc`) | heap helpers (`__mlh`, `__frcoal`) | ~130–650 |
| 32-bit `long` arithmetic | long mul/div/mod helpers | ~30–340 |
| `float` operators | normalise/round core (~700) | ~700–1,050 |
| `math.h` (`sinf`, `expf`, `powf`, …) | float core + conversions | ~1,500–3,300 |
| `string.h` / `ctype.h` | none (self-contained) | ~15–100 |

The exact per-routine `self`/`marginal` numbers — and the transitive
dependencies behind each one — are tabulated on the auto-generated
[*Runtime function sizes*](02-runtime-sizes.md) page, with the optimisation
takeaways in [*Runtime optimization*](01-dccrtlstrip.md). The takeaways for
sizing a program are:

- **Console-only output and string/ctype routines are cheap** — they link
  little or nothing beyond the baseline.
- **The first file, `scanf`, or `float` operation is the expensive one**; it
  links a shared core. Additional routines in the same family are then nearly
  free.
- **`math.h` is the single biggest lever** — the `exp`/`log`/`pow` and
  hyperbolic group runs ~2,000–3,300 lines because each chains other math
  routines on top of the float core.

Those numbers are recomputed from `DCCRTL.MAC` on every docs build, so editing
the runtime and rebuilding the docs is all that is needed to refresh them.

- dcc is a **single-pass, syntax-directed** C89 compiler with **no AST and no
  IR** — code is emitted as the parser recognises each construct, in the
  tradition of the earliest C compilers.
- The one structural weakness of that design (knowing operand types before
  emitting them) is addressed by a **side-effect-free type oracle**, a
  "1.5-pass" technique that restores accurate whole-expression typing without a
  tree.
- Machine-dependent optimization is split out into **`dccpeep`**, a
  fixpoint peephole optimizer over the assembly text, with separate time (`-Ot`)
  and size (`-Os`) strategies.
- The runtime `DCCRTL.MAC` is **block-structured** (~220 independent `public`
  blocks over a ~226-line baseline), so every routine has a measurable
  `self`/`marginal` size cost and `dccrtlstrip` can link only the blocks a
  program references.
- The back half of the pipeline reuses the proven off-the-shelf Microsoft
  **`M80`/`L80`** assembler and linker, so dcc never has to implement object
  formats or relocation itself.
