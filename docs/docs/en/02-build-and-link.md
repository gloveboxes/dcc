# Building and linking

This page covers the path from a `.c` file to a runnable CP/M `.COM` program and
the compiler options that most affect the result. You typically do this in your
**own project directory** — dcc and ntvcm are general-purpose tools for building
CP/M / Z80 C apps anywhere, not just inside the dcc repo. As long as the tools
are on your `PATH` (see [Setting up the toolchain](00-setup-toolchain.md)), the
commands below work from any folder that holds your `.c` sources.

## The one-step helper script

The quickest way to build is the `ma.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `ma.bat` (Windows)
helper script. It compiles, optimizes, strips the runtime, assembles, and links
in one step. Copy `ma.sh` / `ma.bat` from the dcc repo into your own project (or
point at it by path) and run it against your source:

```sh
sh ./ma.sh foo            # builds foo.c -> FOO.COM (peephole optimized)
sh ./ma.sh foo nopeep     # same, but skip the dccpeep optimizer
```

Under the hood this runs the compiler, the optional `dccpeep` peephole
optimizer, the `dccrtlstrip` runtime trimmer, then M80 and L80. Runtime
trimming is part of the normal build path because it keeps the final `.COM`
file from carrying unused library routines. The script
resolves each tool from your `PATH` (or the `DCC` / `DCCPEEP` / `DCCRTLSTRIP`
environment variables), so it does not need to live next to the dcc binaries.

??? note "The manual pipeline (click to expand)"

    If you'd rather drive the steps yourself — or wire them into your own build
    system — the full pipeline for `foo.c` is shown below. `dcc`, `dccpeep`, and
    `dccrtlstrip` are host tools; `m80.com` and `l80.com` are CP/M programs, so run
    them through `ntvcm` (or another CP/M emulator):

    === "macOS / Linux"

        Define the same CRLF helper used by `ma.sh`: prefer `unix2dos` if it is
        installed, otherwise use Perl (available on macOS and common Linux systems).

        ```sh
        to_crlf() {
            if command -v unix2dos >/dev/null 2>&1; then
                unix2dos "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
            else
                perl -0pi -e 's/\r?\n/\r\n/g' "$1"
            fi
        }
        ```

        Compile the C source to M80 assembly, then optionally run the peephole
        optimizer.

        ```sh
        dcc -I /path/to/dcc -stack 512 foo.c -o FOO.MAC
        dccpeep FOO.MAC _PEEPOUT.MAC
        mv _PEEPOUT.MAC FOO.MAC
        ```

        Convert the app assembly to CP/M CRLF text and assemble it with M80 under
        `ntvcm`.

        ```sh
        to_crlf FOO.MAC
        ntvcm m80 "=FOO.MAC" /X /O /Z /L
        ```

        Copy and trim the runtime to only the blocks used by the app.

        ```sh
        cp /path/to/dcc/DCCRTL.MAC DCCRTL.MAC
        to_crlf DCCRTL.MAC
        dccrtlstrip -r DCCRTL.MAC -o RTLMIN.MAC FOO.MAC
        ```

        Convert, assemble, and link the trimmed runtime with the app.

        ```sh
        to_crlf RTLMIN.MAC
        ntvcm m80 "=RTLMIN.MAC" /X /O /Z
        ntvcm l80 "/P:100,RTLMIN,FOO,FOO/N/E"
        ```

    === "Windows PowerShell"

        Define a CRLF helper using PowerShell/.NET APIs.

        ```powershell
        function Convert-ToCrlf($Path) {
            $text = [IO.File]::ReadAllText($Path) -replace "`r?`n", "`r`n"
            [IO.File]::WriteAllText($Path, $text)
        }
        ```

        Compile the C source to M80 assembly, then optionally run the peephole
        optimizer.

        ```powershell
        dcc -I C:\path\to\dcc -stack 512 foo.c -o FOO.MAC
        dccpeep FOO.MAC _PEEPOUT.MAC
        Move-Item -Force _PEEPOUT.MAC FOO.MAC
        ```

        Convert the app assembly to CP/M CRLF text and assemble it with M80 under
        `ntvcm`.

        ```powershell
        Convert-ToCrlf FOO.MAC
        ntvcm m80 "=FOO.MAC" /X /O /Z /L
        ```

        Copy and trim the runtime to only the blocks used by the app.

        ```powershell
        Copy-Item C:\path\to\dcc\DCCRTL.MAC DCCRTL.MAC
        Convert-ToCrlf DCCRTL.MAC
        dccrtlstrip -r DCCRTL.MAC -o RTLMIN.MAC FOO.MAC
        ```

        Convert, assemble, and link the trimmed runtime with the app.

        ```powershell
        Convert-ToCrlf RTLMIN.MAC
        ntvcm m80 "=RTLMIN.MAC" /X /O /Z
        ntvcm l80 "/P:100,RTLMIN,FOO,FOO/N/E"
        ```

    The helper scripts stage `m80.com` and `l80.com` before invoking `ntvcm`. For a
    manual build, keep those `.COM` files and `DCCRTL.MAC` in the working directory
    where you run the pipeline, or adjust the paths to match your layout. Replace
    `/path/to/dcc` (or `C:\path\to\dcc`) with the dcc repo path that contains the
    standard headers; if you run from the dcc repo root, the explicit `-I` is usually
    unnecessary.

    M80 expects CP/M-style CRLF text files; LF-only files can be misread. The Unix
    helper above mirrors `ma.sh`; the Windows helper shown above uses PowerShell/.NET
    APIs.

## The compiler invocation

```text
dcc [options] input.c [-o output.mac]
```

Common options:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-o file` | Write M80 assembly to `file`; default is `out.mac`, `-` is stdout. |
| `-c`, `-module` | Emit a linkable helper module, not a final program translation unit. |
| `-f`, `-ffloatio` | Enable floating-point `printf` formatting support. |
| `-fstack-check` | Emit a lightweight stack-overflow guard in each function prologue. |
| `-s bytes`, `-stack bytes`, `--stack bytes` | Reserve stack bytes; default is 512. |
| `-s=bytes`, `-stack=bytes`, `--stack=bytes` | Equivalent attached forms for the stack size. |
| `-I dir`, `-Idir` | Add an include search directory. |
| `-D name[=value]`, `-Dname[=value]` | Predefine a macro. |
| `-U name`, `-Uname` | Undefine a preprocessor macro. |
| `-v`, `--version` | Print the compiler version and exit. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print compiler help and exit. |

## Options that affect the runtime

- **`-f` / `-ffloatio`** — pull in floating-point support for the `printf`
  family. You **must** pass this if your format strings use `%f`; otherwise
  float formatting is not linked in. This is also the single biggest code-size
  lever — see the [appendix](appendix/01-dccrtlstrip.md).
- **`-s` / `-stack` / `--stack`** — reserve stack space (default 512; accepted
  range 0..32767). The heap used by `malloc` lives between the end of BSS and
  the bottom of the stack, so growing the stack shrinks the heap and vice versa.
  By default there are no runtime checks that stop the stack from smashing the
  heap.
- **`-fstack-check`** — opt in to a lightweight stack-overflow guard. dcc emits
  a short `call __stchk` in each function prologue (after the frame is set up)
  that compares the live stack pointer against the heap ceiling. If the stack
  has grown into the heap, the program prints `?stack overflow` and exits with
  return code `0FFh` instead of silently corrupting memory. The guard costs a
  few bytes and one call per function, so it is **off by default**; turn it on
  while developing or for deeply recursive code. The `stacksize` helper script
  (below) uses this guard to measure the minimum `-stack` reserve an app needs.
- **`-Dname[=value]`** — predefine a macro. `_DCC_=1` is always defined.

### Measuring the stack an app needs

The repo ships a `stacksize` helper that builds your app with `-fstack-check`
forced on and sweeps the `-stack` reserve upward until it runs without tripping
the guard, then prints the minimum and a recommended value with headroom. Run it
against an app/test name (and pass any program arguments after `--`):

=== "macOS / Linux"

    ```sh
    scripts/stacksize.sh triangle          # simple app
    scripts/stacksize.sh cobint -- e.cob   # app that needs a data-file argument
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```bat
    scripts\stacksize.bat triangle
    scripts\stacksize.bat cobint -- e.cob
    ```

Both honour the same `START` / `STEP` / `MAX` / `MODE` / `EMU` environment
variables; see [`scripts/README.md`](https://github.com/davidly/dcc/blob/main/scripts/README.md)
for the full reference.

## Including headers

Include the standard headers as usual:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
```

## Memory layout

CP/M loads `.COM` files in just one way. BSS begins immediately after the loaded
image, and the loader sets `SP` to the highest free byte. The heap grows on
demand between the end of BSS and the bottom of the stack. Because there is no
guard between them by default, size the stack deliberately with `-stack` for
programs with deep recursion or large frames — or build with `-fstack-check`
(above) to turn an overflow into a clean `?stack overflow` exit.
